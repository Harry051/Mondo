Fry the eggplant/aubergine slices in batches until gently browned on each side. Don't be tempted to use too much oil - just enough to stop them sticking. When cooked, put to one side. If they are oily, dry on paper towel (you can also put oilier ones on top off other slices you are cooking and some will drain out to help those ones not stick when you turn over).",

             'Brown the lamb - you may need to turn up the heat a bit - until it is all cooked then add the tomatoes, herbs and some salt and pepper. Stir well and set aside.',
             'In another pan, melt the butter over a medium heat. Add the flour and stir well, cooking until it starts to become slightly nutty, a minute or two.',
             "Turn the heat down a little and add the milk gradually, stirring in well as you go, around 1/2 cup at a time, pressing any lumps to the side of the pan to remove. Don't worry if still a couple.",
             "Add the majority of the cheese (keep back a couple handfuls) and mix through so it melts. Remove from the heat, add the egg and whisk it through.",

It will seem crisp when touched (although be gentle so you don't break it). Turn off the oven and leave the pavlova inside with the door closed for a further 50min-1 hour. This will help avoid it sinking and cracking.",
